# Disclaimer

HealthSphere X is designed as an assistive health monitoring solution that empowers users with early insights into potential health conditions — particularly those related to body temperature, heart rate, and other vitals. While our device leverages smart sensors, AI-based analysis, and remote health support tools, it is **not a replacement for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment**.

## What You Can Expect
- **Quick, real-time insights** on abnormal temperature or vitals
- **AI suggestions** for mild or early-stage symptoms
- **Remote alerts** for caregivers or health professionals
- **Educational feedback** to promote proactive health behavior

## Important Notes
- If you experience **severe symptoms** (e.g., persistent fever, dizziness, breathing difficulty, or intense fatigue), **consult a licensed medical professional immediately**.
- HealthSphere X is **not a certified diagnostic device**, and all results should be interpreted as preliminary or advisory.
- The AI component is designed to **support, not replace**, a doctor's judgment — especially in complex or emergency cases.
- Do not delay or disregard medical advice based on automated feedback from this device.

## Our Commitment
We are committed to expanding access to health support tools — especially in underserved communities. HealthSphere X is built to complement existing healthcare systems and help users make better-informed decisions about their well-being.

Always use this device responsibly and in line with the provided user guidelines. Your health is important, and we encourage working with qualified professionals alongside using this innovation.
