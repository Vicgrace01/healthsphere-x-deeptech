# HealthSphere X ‚Äî Offline-First Predictive Health Monitoring

**HealthSphere X** is a low-power AI-powered diagnostic device designed for rural and underserved areas. It runs on an ESP32 microcontroller, performs illness prediction locally, and logs vital data to an SD card ‚Äî all without internet access.

## Features
- üí° Predicts illness severity based on temperature, age, and medical history
- ‚ö° Optimized for ESP32 with SD card logging (offline-first)
- üîê Privacy-first: No cloud dependency
- üß† AI model inference from local storage
- üß™ Simulation scripts for development/testing
- üå°Ô∏è Threshold logic for dynamic alerts

## Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `esp32_healthsphere.ino` | Core firmware for ESP32 (reads data, predicts, logs) |
| `predict.py` | AI logic for illness condition prediction |
| `thresholds.py` | Defines risk thresholds used in prediction |
| `simulate.py` | Simulates multiple prediction cases for testing |
| `prediction_log.json` | Auto-generated logs from local predictions |
| `README.md` | Project overview and structure explanation |

## Usage

### On ESP32
- Flash `esp32_healthsphere.ino` via Arduino IDE
- Ensure SD card is inserted for data logging
- Input temperature and vitals via connected sensor
- Device will:
  1. Predict illness level
  2. Store result in `prediction_log.json` (SD)
  3. Display recommendation

### On PC (for development)
- Run `simulate.py` to generate test predictions
- Adjust `thresholds.py` to test new logic
- Analyze outputs using `prediction_log.json`

## Simulation Example

```bash
python simulate.py
